    * Invalid words are rejected, and a message is displayed asking
      the user to choose another word until they enter a valid word or "."
    * When a valid word is entered, it uses up letters from the hand.

      the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the user
      is asked to input another word.

    * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters or the user
      inputs a "."
